 Firing Sequence
  vv
   check if the atomizer reports no errors
   check if v isn't too high for regulator
   check if v wouldn't raise output over watts limit
   fire at selected volts
    break if FIRE is released
    break if timer = 10
  vw
   check if atomizer reports no errors
   check if w isn't over limit
   check if v to get w isn't too high for regulator
   fire at calculated volts
    break if FIRE is released
    break if fire > 10
  bp
   check if atomizer reports no errors
   check if v wouldn't raise output over watts limit
   fire at battery volts
    break if FIRE is released
    break if timer > 10
  tc
   check if atomizer reports no errors
   calc coil temperature
   calc PID algorithm
   check if pid_v isn't over regulator limit
   check if w isn't over limit
   fire at pid_v
    break if FIRE is released
    break if timer > 10
