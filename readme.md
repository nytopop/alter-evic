**** alter-evic

An alternate firmware for Evic VTC-Mini devices.

Take care as the working state is still *experimental*!.

Currently working:

* VV mode
* Bypass mode
* TC mode, but TCR is hardcoded for now (0.0045).

Notes:

* wattage is limited to *80w*, and battery load amps are displayed as "bA", take care not to overdrain your batteries.

Issues

base resistance is not reset when switching coils
